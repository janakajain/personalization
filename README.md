Computers may not understand emotions the way we do, but they can definitely fake to do it, and do it better than us.
Personalization of technology is a very interesting topic and is highly relevant today.

I am taking a course on "Personalization Theory and Applications" by [Prof. Brett Vintch](http://www.cns.nyu.edu/~vintch/) this semester. It has just been a week but I can totally see myself loving the course already. Throughout the semester, I will update this repository with resources, code and my thoughts on the subject - consider it like a Journal on Personalization (I think this would make a nice title, indeed!).
