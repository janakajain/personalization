Personalization is a broad term and covers several knowledge areas including recommendation systems, machine learning, psychology and mathematics. The resources mentioned below will help you get a better perspective of and learn more about personalization. Please feel free to suggest any addition to these resources.  
  
1. Recommender Systems - _[by Charu C Aggarwal](http://charuaggarwal.net/)_  
	This is the recommended textbook for the course on "Personalization Theory and Applications" at Columbia University (Fall 2017). Written by Charu C Aggarwal, who is a Distinguished Research Staff Member (DRSM) at IBM T. J. Watson Research Center, New York, this book covers a lot of topics on recommender systems including content-based, behaviour-based, knowledge-based, time-sensitive, context-sensitive and other specific types of recommender systems while also discussing about advanced recommender systems in the last section.  
2. Mining Massive Datasets <text color='green'>(free)</text>- _[by Anand Rajaraman and Jeffrey Ullman](http://infolab.stanford.edu/~ullman/mmds/book.pdf)_  
	This book contains a chapter on recommendation systems which can be a quick read for understanding recommendation systems.

# Organizations working on Personalization   
  
1. [GroupLens Research](https://grouplens.org/)  
	GroupLens is an active research group based out of University of Minnesota that works on social computing and recommedation systems. The group website some really nice resources and datasets to work on and is a good starting point for experimenters in 	the field to get to know more about the research area. The group's website describes its mission as:  
	>"We advance the theory and practice of social computing by building and understanding systems used by real people."  
	
	The professors affiliated with the group are also offering a specialization course on Recommendation Systems on Coursera. You can check this course [here](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/recommender-systems).

1. [Personalization (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personalization): The Wikipedia article talks about personalization in a very generalized sense. However, it is a good point to get a good perspective about its implications outside data science.  
  
2. [N=1, R=G](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Age_of_Innovation): In their famous book _New Age of Innovation_, CK Prahalad and MS Krishnan talk about N=1, R=G systems. N=1 means focus on each individual customer. R=G means focus on horizontal integration of supply chain. While the R=G system may not be directly relatable initially, upon careful thought, it can be applied to several cases of recommendation engines as well. Nevertheless, the model is a very good concept and a read of this article is recommended.
